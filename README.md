## About Me
A driven and ambitious software engineer with a strong passion for gaining new experiences and expanding my knowledge base. With a diverse skill set, I have sharpened my abilities through hands-on experience in creating and maintaining multiple websites for small businesses in the Tri-State area. Over the past four years, I have continued to build on this foundation, continually refining and tweaking the sites as my skill set grows.

- Actively involved in developing several React Native
apps with a focus on addressing the unique needs of various
businesses. One of these apps is specifically designed to track worker
on-the-clock hours and report them to a Business Administrator, while
another aims to help small businesses expand their customer base and
enhance their outreach.
